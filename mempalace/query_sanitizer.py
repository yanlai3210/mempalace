"""
query_sanitizer.py — Mitigate system prompt contamination in search queries.

Problem: AI agents sometimes prepend system prompts (2000+ chars) to search queries.
Embedding models represent the concatenated string as a single vector where the
system prompt overwhelms the actual question (typically 10-50 chars), causing
near-total retrieval failure (89.8% → 1.0% R@10). See Issue #333.

Approach: "Mitigation" (減災) — not perfect prevention, but prevents the cliff.

Expected recovery:
  Step 1 passthrough (≤200 chars)     → no degradation, ~89.8%
  Step 2 question extraction (？found) → near-full recovery, ~85-89%
  Step 3 tail sentence extraction      → moderate recovery, ~80-89%
  Step 4 tail truncation (fallback)    → minimum viable, ~70-80%

  Without sanitizer: 1.0% (catastrophic silent failure)
  Worst case with sanitizer: ~70-80% (survivable)
