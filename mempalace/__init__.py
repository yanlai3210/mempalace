# ChromaDB 0.6.x ships a Posthog telemetry client whose capture() signature is
# incompatible with the bundled posthog library, producing noisy stderr warnings
# on every client operation ("Failed to send telemetry event … capture() takes
# 1 positional argument but 3 were given").  Silence just that logger.

# NOTE: the previous block set ``ORT_DISABLE_COREML=1`` on macOS arm64 as a
# supposed workaround for the #74 ARM64 segfault.  Two problems:
#
# 1. ONNX Runtime does not read that env var -- it has no global way to
#    disable a single execution provider, so the setdefault was a no-op.
# 2. #74 is a null-pointer crash in ``chromadb_rust_bindings.abi3.so``, not
#    an ONNX issue, so disabling CoreML would not have fixed it anyway.
#
# #521 has since traced the actual macOS arm64 crashes (both in mine and
# search paths) to the 0.x chromadb hnswlib binding.  Filtering
# CoreMLExecutionProvider at the ONNX layer leaves the hnswlib C++ crash
# intact, so the real fix is upgrading chromadb to 1.5.4+, which #581
# proposes.  See #397 for the history of this line.
